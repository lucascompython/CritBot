This is discord bot written in discord.py v2.0 that aims at exploring the possibilities of a discord bot.<br>Right now the bot is quite simple and most of the code aims at extensibility.<br>The bot has a custom implementation of i18n.<br>You can invite the bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=832679098740506644&permissions=8&scope=bot).

## Installation & Execution
